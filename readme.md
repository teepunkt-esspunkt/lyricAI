i follow andrej karpathys zero to hero ml tutorial.

now i want to scrape lyrics and create a lyrics generator, or something like that, im not 100% set yet

just doing it for fun/excercise/science 

so far:
- enter artist name to get albumlinks
- get song links per albumlink (only 1 file atm)

missing:
get lyrics from song links
clean and combine all
train on it
???

optional: 
nicer song links per albumlinks (but for what?)
gui?
host it? (how?)
