i followed andrej karpathys zero to hero ml tutorial.

now i want to scrape lyrics and create a lyrics generator, or something like that, im not 100% set yet

just doing it for fun/excercise/science 

so far:
- enter artist name to get albumlinks
- get song link per albumlink
- get lyrics from song links* (artist folder still broken)
- clean and combine all*
- train on it

missing:
*remove 2x,3x mentions (without brackets)
???

optional: 
books??
gui?
host it? (how?)
